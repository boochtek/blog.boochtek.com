	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> was written in 2001, as a way to explain the common values amongst several &#8220;light-weight&#8221; software development methodologies that had come about. The term &#8220;Agile&#8221; was chosen as a shorthand for those commonalities.</p>
<p>Once &#8220;Agile&#8221; started to show success, we started to see many people use the term to market their products and services, whether or not they really believed in the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where some of us don&#8217;t see much value in using the term &#8220;Agile&#8221; any more. Even some of those involved in creating the manifesto have suggested new terms. Dave Thomas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/">suggests</a> &#8220;Agility&#8221; and Andy Hunt has started working on something called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://growsmethod.com/">GROWS</a>. Personally, I&#8217;m considering going back to the term &#8220;Extreme Programming&#8221;, even though I&#8217;ve incorporated ideas from other Agile methodologies.</p>
<p>It recently occurred to me that Agile, when done &#8220;right&#8221;, is closely aligned with the happiness of the team members. This is really interesting, because it aligns the interests of the employees and the business &#8212; a win-win situation. My next thought was that maybe the next step after &#8220;Agile&#8221; will be a focus on happiness and motivation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently been thinking about personal motivation lately, in the context of team practices. According to Daniel Pink&#8217;s book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805"><i>Drive</i></a>, people are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose. I personally add a fourth that can sometimes trump the other three: identity. And of course, happiness can also be motivating &#8212; both in the attempt to achieve happiness and in just <i>being</i> happy. (I suspect that happiness is more of a parallel to motivation than a <em>cause</em> though.)</p>
<p>There are a couple different ways that happiness can be achieved at work. The traditional way is for work to be a means to an end. In this view, the purpose of your job is to provide the money to live your life (outside of work) the way that you want to live it. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this way of thinking. But for the lucky few, we can work on something that makes us happy in and of itself. That&#8217;s generally done by finding a job doing something that we enjoy.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&#8217;s thinking about things the wrong way. For one, plenty of people who have gone that route are still unhappy at work. I think a lot of that has to do more with the context surrounding the work than the work itself. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a lousy manager. Maybe you don&#8217;t like the people you work with. Maybe the tools you have to work with are bad. Maybe the processes add a lot of unnecessary tedium.</p>
<p>So maybe we need to find ways to be happier at work. Most of the Agile practices seem to make team members happy. For example, replacing a light-weight process for a heavier process always makes me happy. And I typically leave retrospectives in a good mood. So that&#8217;s a good starting point. But we should see if we can take the idea further. If we take employee happiness as a core value, where can we go? What kind of practices would we want to add? Please share any ideas in the comments below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On a recent episode (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://www.thisagilelife.com/78/">78</a>) of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://www.thisagilelife.com/">This Agile Life</a>, my fellow hosts talked about when to do Test-Driven Development (TDD). They all said that you should always do TDD &#8212; at least for anything that will go into production; there&#8217;s an exception for experimenting or &#8220;spiking&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t on that episode, but later commented on the topic. (Episode 83 &#8212; which wasn&#8217;t really all that great.) My take was slightly different. I said that you should do TDD only when the benefits outweigh the costs. Unfortunately, we usually greatly underestimate the benefits. And the costs often seem high at first, because it takes some time to get good at writing automated tests. Not to mention that both the costs and the benefits are usually hard to measure.</p>
<p>What is the cost of writing automated tests? I&#8217;ve asked this question before and recorded the answers (inasmuch as we have them) in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://blog.boochtek.com/2014/05/05/tdd-is-alive-and-well">previous blog entry</a>. TDD costs us about 10-30% in short-term productivity. The benefit that they found was a reduction in bugs by 30-90%, and a decrease in code complexity by about 30%.</p>
<p>But what about when the costs are higher than the normal 10 to 30 percent? One good example of this is when there’s no test framework for the situation you’re testing. This might be a new language or framework that you’re working with. More likely it’s a complex API that you have to mock out. So that could increase the cost of automated testing so as to outweigh the benefits &#8212; especially on a short project. I could imagine situations where the cost of writing the mocks could eat up more than the project itself.</p>
<p>Another case where we might consider skipping testing is when we’re more concerned about time to market than quality. This is almost always a mistake. Your code will almost always last longer than you expect. (Remember Y2K?) And if the code lasts longer than you expect, that means you&#8217;ll have to deal with bugs that whole time. But we have to work with the information we have at the time we make our decisions. And sometimes that might tell us that time to market is more important than anything.</p>
<p>One final case I can imagine is when a true expert is coding something that they&#8217;re very familiar with. I could picture someone like Uncle Bob writing code (in a language that he&#8217;s familiar with) without tests just as effectively as I could write code with tests.</p>
<p>But these situations should not be common; they’re edge cases. In almost all real-world cases, TDD is the right thing to do. Don&#8217;t forget, TDD is also a design discipline &#8212; it helps you design a better API. So keep doing TDD. But as with any practice, don&#8217;t do it blindly without considering why we&#8217;re doing it. Make sure you understand the costs, and whether the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I ran into some former colleagues recently, from a company where I had worked to help transform the team to be more Agile. They&#8217;ve gone through some reorganization and management changes recently. One of the guys said that their team culture has helped them maintain quality in the face of those changes. This struck me as odd, since I had considered the work I had done there as somewhat of a disappointment. While I felt I had made a small dent, I didn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;d made a true Agile transformation. Much of what I had taught didn&#8217;t seem to &#8220;stick&#8221;.</p>
<p>Later that night I thought about why my opinion of the team and his opinion were so different. There are a lot of reasons why an Agile &#8220;transformation&#8221; could fail. It could be due to lack of support from management. Or even worse, not getting the team members to buy into the ideas &#8212; usually due to fear of change. But while those had some effect in this case, they weren&#8217;t really the main issues. Now that I&#8217;ve had some time and some distance from that team, I&#8217;ve gained some clarity on what the real issues were.</p>
<p>I think the reason that I think this transformation was a failure was due to the continued pace of change that true Agile requires. Basically the team experienced &#8220;change fatigue&#8221;, where everything keeps changing and you feel like you can never catch your breath. But the more interesting thing is how our perceptions differed. He seemed to think that the transformation was a success &#8212; they&#8217;re doing things better than they used to. I view it as more of a failure, because they basically stopped improving &#8212; at least at the pace that I was hoping for.</p>
<p>I think this difference in mindset is pretty fundamental. My view of Agile involves continuous improvement &#8212; always inspecting and adapting our processes. I suppose that means that my preferred flavor of Agile is &#8220;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223716/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">Kaizen</a>&#8220;. But other people don&#8217;t see improvement and change as a constant &#8212; they see each change as a means to an end. I&#8217;m starting to realize that neither viewpoint is objectively correct. Maybe they&#8217;re both fine viewpoints to have. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t be so hard on myself and view that engagement as a failure, especially if my teammates view it as a success. Maybe perfection is the enemy of the good. And maybe I need to learn to be happy with &#8220;good enough&#8221;.</p>
