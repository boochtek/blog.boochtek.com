		<p>I&#8217;m wrapping up my current consulting gig at Mercy in December, and starting a new gig at CenturyLink. I&#8217;m a software developer, but that&#8217;s only a part of what I do. What I really do is join a team and help them improve the way they work — both their processes and their technical skills.</p>
<p>I think this is a key differentiator for me as a consultant. Most consultants (and Agile coaches) come in and tell people what to do. I don&#8217;t like to just tell people what to do. I&#8217;d much prefer to work side-by-side with them, getting a better understanding of what their challenges are. Once I have a better understanding of the challenges, I&#8217;m able to better brainstorm some ideas to try. Then we can experiment to see what will work and what won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Instead of telling people what to do, I show them how. Most people learn better from seeing than from hearing. They also learn better if you explain how and why, not just what. So showing them how to do something is more effective than telling them. By showing and doing, you can also set<span style="font-weight: 300;"> a good example. This is especially important when collaboration is a large part of what needs to be improved.</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that this style of consulting is more highly respected by everyone. I build trust with developers by working closely with them. Managers<span style="font-weight: 300;"> like to keep me around once they see how effective these methods can be, so the gigs I take on tend to last relatively long.</span></p>
<p>The biggest problem I have is explaining how this works. I don&#8217;t really know what to put on my résumé. Sometimes I call myself an Agile practitioner, and sometimes an Agile player/coach. But those aren&#8217;t terribly satisfying descriptions. I&#8217;m considering actually putting &#8220;I help teams improve the way they work — both their processes and their technical skills&#8221; on the résumé. But that seems awkward, and misses the show versus tell part. I&#8217;d be open to any suggestions.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I facilitated a retrospective today; it was one of the best retros I&#8217;ve ever been involved with. I figured out what activities I wanted to do earlier in the morning. They were really quite simple. I wanted to focus on happiness.</p>
<h2>How happy are you at work?</h2>
<p>I started with two questions that I&#8217;ve used with teams before, to some success (although not so successful for one particular team). The first question I asked was &#8220;How happy are you at work?&#8221; I had them put a rating from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning they should have quit last week, and 10 meaning they couldn&#8217;t imaging being happier at work.</p>
<p>The answers were mostly 7s and 8s, with a 5 and a 9. The average came to 7.5, which is pretty good. The 5 concerns me a bit, especially that it&#8217;s 2 points lower than anyone else&#8217;s answer.</p>
<h2>How effective do you think the teams is?</h2>
<p>The next question I asked was &#8220;How effective do you think the teams is?&#8221;. Again, from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning they can&#8217;t accomplish anything, and 10 meaning you couldn&#8217;t imagine a more effective team.</p>
<p>When I ask both of these questions, the scores are always highly correlated. If your team isn&#8217;t doing good work, it&#8217;ll make you unhappy. And if you are unhappy, you&#8217;re less likely to do your best work. This team was no different; the 5 and 9 became a 6 and a 10, and most of the 7s became 8s, for an average of just under 8.</p>
<h2>What makes you happy at work?</h2>
<p>The next question I asked was &#8220;What makes you happy at work?&#8221;. The answers were mostly about the teamwork and teammates. This went quicker than I expected. At this point, I was worried the retro would only last a little more than 30 minutes.</p>
<h2>What would make you happier at work?</h2>
<p>The final question I asked was &#8220;What would make you happier at work?&#8221;. This was the real pay-off. We spent about half an hour just talking about the things that would make us happier, and what we could do to improve our happiness. We came up with 10 potential action items. I usually limit teams to trying 3 or 4 action items, but most of the items are quite small, so we&#8217;re going to try 6 of them. One is just observing another team&#8217;s standup meetings, to see how they&#8217;re using their time effectively.</p>
<p>Everyone went away feeling that this was a really good retro. It felt good to focus on happiness. Happiness is something I&#8217;ve been talking a lot about on the This Agile Life podcast, and it felt good to take some action on it. I&#8217;ve done &#8220;positive-only&#8221; retros before, but this one felt even better than that, by specifically targeting happiness and how we can achieve it.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223202/http://blog.boochtek.com/2015/11/02/impromptu-retrospective" rel="bookmark">Impromptu Retrospective</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m surprised that I haven&#8217;t gotten this story down in print before. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve mentioned many times — including a few times on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223202/http://www.thisagilelife.com/">the podcast</a>. It&#8217;s a great story about the power of retrospectives, and it&#8217;s a great story about the power of a blameless post-mortem.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall all the specifics at this point. It was about 5 years ago. I&#8217;d just noticed that Arun had made some sort of mistake. That&#8217;s fine, people make mistakes. The thing that was different about his mistake was that I had made the same mistake about a week prior. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510223202/http://dirtyinformation.com/">Amos</a> had made the same mistake about a week before that.</p>
<p>Noticing a pattern of mistakes, Amos and I called an impromptu retrospective. We gathered all the developers into a conference room. We explained the problem that we were running into. At first, Arun was defensive. That&#8217;s understandable; he thought we were there to come down on him, to lay blame. But we made it clear that we weren&#8217;t focusing on him. We admitted that we had also made the same mistake recently. We weren&#8217;t there to lay blame; we were there to figure out how our team could stop making the mistake. It took Arun a few minutes to get over the defensiveness.</p>
<p>With the defensiveness out of the way, we could focus on the issue at hand. We were able to figure out the root cause of us all making the mistake. (I don&#8217;t know if we played the &#8220;5 whys&#8221; game, but I&#8217;m sure we effectively did something similar.) And with that, we were able to change our process, so that nobody else would make the same mistake again.</p>
<p>There are 2 important points to this story. First, you don&#8217;t have to wait until a scheduled retrospective to hold a retrospective. This one was impromptu, and it&#8217;s the best one we ever had. We saw a problem, addressed it, and found a solution in less than an hour. Had we waited until the end of the week, we would have forgotten some of the details, and wouldn&#8217;t have been as effective at solving the problem. Second, when addressing problems, take your ego out of the equation. If you&#8217;re in a position of authority, take the blame — but never place blame. Focus on what&#8217;s important — solving the problem.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget the Retrospective Prime Directive:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.</p></blockquote>
