		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you were able to get the DecaTxt connected and working.  We are planning for a second version with micro USB rather than mini and a few software changes like being able to shut off the Bluetooth antenna. I&#039;d love to get your feedback if you would email me and offer suggestions.
Thanks,
Wayne]]></description>

I was wondering if you had made any progress with it?  It seems like a language I would enjoy working with.

		<description><![CDATA[Update: It works just fine! Actually the problem was that my laptop only supports Bluetooth 3.0, but at least 4.0 is needed. It also wasn&#039;t discoverable by my phone because Android 4.3 or newer is needed. Tested it on a newer phone and on my work PC and it connected straight away. Looking forward to trying it on an Android tablet and measuring my speed over a few weeks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The In10did DecaTxt is available on eBay and Amazon now. I ordered one recently and had it shipped over from the USA, which was a bit expensive when customs fees are added. It arrived yesterday morning and I plugged it in after arriving home from work. Sadly, it appears to do nothing whatsoever. Not sure if this model is DOA (but surely they test them?), or what. If I can get it to work, or get a replacement shipped, I&#039;ll try to record my WPM with the device every day for a couple of weeks, to see where the improvement curve starts to taper off.]]></description>
