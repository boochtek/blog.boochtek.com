	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not too long ago, I was asked during a job interview &#8220;how do you convince your teammates that you&#8217;re right?&#8221; I answered with probably the most surprising answer: &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me years to realize that being right isn&#8217;t terribly important. Especially when there&#8217;s more than one right answer — which there usually is. It&#8217;s more important to work as a team. It&#8217;s more important to be respected and to have respect for others.</p>
<p>A few weeks after that interview, I was pair programming with the person who had asked me the question. We&#8217;re both senior developers, so we both have a lot of experience and opinions based on that experience. We were writing a shell script, and we both had an idea in mind about how to write the code. I let him proceed with his idea. It was a pretty good idea; probably better than mine. But we paired very effectively. I&#8217;d let him finish some code, and I&#8217;d find a way to make it better. Then he&#8217;d find a way to make my code better. What we ended up with was so much better than my original idea, and his original idea as well. I commented on this, and he agreed. We left that pairing session feeling the high of having accomplished something rare — two very experience programmers coming up with better code than we could have imagined going in.</p>
<p>I like to think of writing code as a path towards a destination. The destination is good code that does what it&#8217;s supposed to, is readable (intention revealing), is concise, and is well-factored so as to be easy to change in the future. But there are many paths to that destination. Especially when pair programming, the code gets refined as ideas are shared, getting you closer and closer to that destination. Sometimes the different paths end up with the same code; sometimes they end up with different code. But if the code does its job well (according to those criteria), it doesn&#8217;t really matter what code you ended up with.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the original question, I think the answer is a little more nuanced. (I&#8217;m pretty sure I followed up with an explanation, but I don&#8217;t recall the details.) It truly doesn&#8217;t matter in a lot of cases. If there are different paths that lead to the same destination, and they&#8217;re all roughly equal, then my rule works. It can also work even if the first path you try (a &#8220;wrong&#8221; path) doesn&#8217;t work out, as long as it&#8217;s easy enough to try a different path. I find that the majority of day-to-day coding fits these conditions.</p>
<p>But there are some places where it&#8217;s costly to get things wrong the first time. In these cases, it&#8217;s worth spending some time thinking about and discussing the alternatives before getting started. Software architecture is the big one that comes to mind. In general, weighing the pros and cons of each option and applying previous experience works best.</p>
<p>So next time you think about trying to convince someone you&#8217;re right, fight the urge. Instead, let them show you what they&#8217;re thinking. They just might surprise you. And more importantly, you might surprise yourself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently attended an Open Space hosted at work. I&#8217;d never been to an Open Space, and didn&#8217;t know what to expect. We&#8217;d been told that this was a workshop to help Engineering Managers (my role), Product Owners, and Product Analysts find better ways of working together. But due to the way an Open Space works, it evolved into something completely different — and better.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d brought in Diana Larsen to facilitate the Open Space. Diana is a stalwart of the Agile community, focusing on how people and teams interact. She literally (co-)wrote the book on Agile retrospectives. Diana was also kind enough to be our guest at an Agile LINC meetup later in the evening.</p>
<p>The morning started off with all the participants sitting in chairs arranged in a circle. Diana rang a chime, a nice soothing tone that literally set the tone for the day. (Most people didn&#8217;t seem to like it, but I thought it had its purpose.) It also acted as a call to gather in the meeting space. She then walked around the inside of the circle as she explained what was going to happen.</p>
<p>The idea behind Open Spaces came with the realization that at a conference, the &#8220;hallway track&#8221; (ad hoc discussions in the hallways) was often more valuable than the scheduled talks. So they figured out a way to capture that experience. There are only a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoever shows up is the right group</li>
<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>
<li>Be prepared to be surprised</li>
<li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s over</li>
<li>The Law of 2 Feet: If you&#8217;re not learning or contributing, go somewhere else</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Diana set the scene and explained the rules, people came up and presented ideas for topics. If you proposed a topic, you chose a time and location on the topic board. At that time, you&#8217;d facilitate a discussion on that topic. The format was really conducive to discussions. There was no preparation, so discussions were from the heart — lots of people felt that they could contribute.</p>
<p>Being new to the company (only 2 months), I got a lot out of the workshop, beyond the content itself. I got to get to know several more people. I&#8217;d even say I made a few friends. Having open discussions, we found that many of the teams were having the same issues. This made it easy for me to talk to other people.</p>
<p>All-in-all, I found the Open Space to be extremely conducive to discussions aimed at identifying issues, brainstorming solutions, and planning action items. I felt like we made great strides in addressing some of the biggest problems our organization is currently facing.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve written up a list of career-related resolutions the past few years. I&#8217;ve been pretty successful meeting those goals, so I&#8217;m going to continue the tradition.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I want to increase the <a href="https://github.com/boochtek">Open Source code I write</a> this year. That&#8217;s basically everything I write that&#8217;s not directly related to work.</p>
<p>I took over maintenance of <a href="https://github.com/solnic/virtus#readme">Virtus</a> late last year, but haven&#8217;t done a good job at finding the time for that. That&#8217;s probably more responding to issues on GitHub and merging pull requests. But eventually, I&#8217;ll likely add some features and do some refactoring.</p>
<p>My goal is to work on 6 apps and libraries this year. That&#8217;s a pretty aggressive goal, but I want to focus on both learning new things and building some simple but useful things. Think MVP — focus on getting a lot of bang for not too much effort.</p>
<p>I want to work on a new Rails app, to familiarize myself with Rails 5. I want to get some experience with some more modern gems. I also want to see if I can use some new techniques with a Rails app, especially things that might help us get closer to a hexagonal architecture. I&#8217;m also hoping to work with some different web frameworks — maybe Lotus, Rodakase, Trailblazer, or Phoenix. Or maybe one of the Crystal web frameworks.</p>
<p>I also want to work on a couple Elm apps. I started the STL Elm group as an excuse to learn the language. I&#8217;d like to work on a Twitter client, that might eventually turn into a more general reading app. Beyond Twitter, it would keep track of things I want to read. The other Elm app I&#8217;d like to write is a game, based on the old Space Taxi game I loved to play on the Commodore 64.</p>
<p>I wrote a micro-ORM last year called <a href="https://github.com/boochtek/ruby_preserves">Ruby Preserves</a>. I&#8217;ve started converting that from working with raw SQL to sitting atop the awesome <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/index.html">Sequel</a> gem. The simplicity is still there so far, and basing it on Sequel has so far gone easier than I expected. But I haven&#8217;t figured out how to do relationships (JOINs) yet; that will be the real test.</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with my 2015 conference experience. I want to keep my conference level about the same. I don&#8217;t really want to commit to more talks than I gave last year. Conference presentations take a lot of time and energy to write and practice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to go to RailsConf, RubyConf, and Strange Loop. I&#8217;m hoping to give a talk at each of those, if I can. But I&#8217;ll probably attend all of them even if I&#8217;m not speaking. I&#8217;m also submitting a talk to Agile 2016. I&#8217;m unlikely to go to any other conferences, and even more unlikely to give more than 4 conference talks.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I really want to finish my Effective Agile book this year. I&#8217;m going to try to pull Amos in to pair with me on it occasionally, to move it forward. If I&#8217;m able to get it done, I&#8217;d also like to maybe write a book on Elm.</p>
<p>I actually want to do <strong>less</strong> blogging this year. Well, sort of. I want to put coding and book writing ahead of blogging. If that means less blogging, I&#8217;m okay with that. So my goal for blogging is more like every other week. And when I do write a blog article, I&#8217;d rather it be related to some code I&#8217;m working on, something that I could use in my book, or some more in-depth thoughts about programming language design.</p>
<h2>Job Hunting</h2>
<p>The contract I recently started at <a href="https://www.ctl.io/">CenturyLink Cloud</a> is open-ended, so I&#8217;ll likely be there for the entire year. I&#8217;m enjoying it so far; it&#8217;s a challenge, but I think I can make a significant impact. However, I&#8217;m really interested in moving to San Francisco in 2017. So I&#8217;m going to work on preparing for that in several ways.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to resurrect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigbuchek">my LinkedIn account</a>. I&#8217;ve neglected it for a few years now. I&#8217;ll make sure everything is up to date, and make some connections I&#8217;ve been putting off. I also want to reclaim my Stack Exchange and Hacker News accounts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to pay a an expert to help me revamp <a href="https://github.com/booch/resume">my résumé</a>. I think it&#8217;s pretty decent, but it could use some freshening up. I want it to stand out. I want to do a better job of explaining what I really do — which is to join a team to help them improve their processes and their technical skills.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also need to clean up all my web sites, so they look nice when people come to take a look at them. This includes my personal site, consulting business site, wiki, and blogs. I should also upgrade my server to the latest version of Debian, and use Ansible and some other tools to provision it using the principles of Infrastructure as Code.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I held a retrospective with my new team last week. The team includes 2 senior developers, 2 junior developers, a product owner, and a product analyst. I&#8217;ve joined the team as an engineering manager, which I think of more as a team lead with an elevated title. Being new to this group, I wanted a way to understand their values. What motivates them? What common values do we share that we can leverage to move forward in the same direction?</p>
<p>I started out with a pretty simple question: &#8220;What do you value (in regards to what we&#8217;re building); what are you willing to fight for?&#8221; I asked them each to write down several values and then put them on the board before looking at everyone else&#8217;s answers. I also asked each person to rank their values in order of importance.</p>
<p>It turned out that my question was a little vague. Some people thought about the question in terms of the end result, and some in terms of the process of creating the software. In some ways that was a bit of a problem, because the different interpretations led people in different directions. But in other ways, not pushing them in any particular direction got more varied answers, exposing how they think about the project and the product.</p>
<p>My list (in order) was Effectiveness (doing the right thing), Quality (doing things right the first time), Happiness, Purpose, and Teamwork. In retrospect, I should have put Happiness first. If I&#8217;m not happy at work, I don&#8217;t really want to be there, and need to move on. (Sometimes I can trade some happiness at work for more happiness at home, but I&#8217;m definitely a person that needs to be happy at work.) The other values serve to improve my happiness, but the happiness is more important.</p>
<p>My own issue ranking my values turned out to be a problem with the ranking in general. Should they be ranked in importance of the necessity of the value as an outcome, or in importance of the necessity to focus on the value? I think the former is what I was looking for, but even I wasn&#8217;t clear on that when I began the exercise.</p>
<p>After everyone put their values up on the board, we read them off. Then I asked the team to choose several values that we share as a team. We pulled them off the individual members&#8217; lists, and put them in the team list. Then I asked each person to come up and rank those values, then explain why they had ordered them that way, especially when they ordered them significantly different than the last person. I was hoping to come to some convergence of the rank over time, so we could document our values in rank order. That didn&#8217;t happen. But the discussion was illuminating to me and to everyone on the team.</p>
<p>I think the most interesting part about the lack of convergence was the difference between the developers and the product guys. The product guys definitely viewed the values more in terms of outcomes than the process. That makes sense — they&#8217;re not as intimately involved in the process of building the product.</p>
<p>We were able to converge on the top priority though: Will the user buy the product? This was a combination of a couple different values that we merged together. This included the end user experience as well as making sure the team would continue to have a reason for existing. The rest of the values we left unordered: <span class="s1">Teamwork (cohesiveness), Data driven decisions, Team ownership, Simplicity, Effectiveness, Maintainability / Supportability, Quality, Automation, and Performance. I think that&#8217;s a pretty decent list.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">As a couple teammates pointed out, those values are probably in part a reflection of this current point in time. If I asked the same question some other time, under different conditions and team dynamics, the answers would probably change a bit. And we&#8217;d probably come up with other answers if asked again, just due to randomness of the way we think about these things.</span></p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d do this activity a second time with the team. It was really about understanding our motivations — both our own, and those of our teammates. I found it effective in that way, and also in helping the team to think about our culture and how we can work to shape it to help us all push in the same direction.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats. When I asked for feedback on the exercise, one teammate pointed out that it wouldn&#8217;t work if people weren&#8217;t honest about their values, and they answered with what they thought management or their teammates wanted to hear. I don&#8217;t think that was an issue with this group, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The other major thing I&#8217;d do is to make it clear up front that I&#8217;m not looking for any action items from this activity; it&#8217;s more about understanding each other and ourselves. And next time, I&#8217;ll work to clarify how to rank the values.</p>
<p>I would recommend this activity for a new team, or when the makeup of the team is changing in some significant way. I wish there was a way to help a team converge on the ranking of their values, but I suppose I should be happy that agreeing on the set of important values went pretty quickly. And the diversity of ideas and opinions is probably a blessing that I should be embracing — the more ideas we have, the wider the variety of solutions we can imagine.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://blog.boochtek.com/2015/12/28/year-in-review-2015" rel="bookmark">2015 Year in Review</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again — time for a retrospective on how I did on <a href="http://blog.boochtek.com/2015/02/02/resolutions">my goals</a> for the year. I had 5 main goals for 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job Hunting</li>
<li>Conferences</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Programming Language Design</li>
<li>Writing an Agile Book</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job Hunting</h2>
<p>I got pretty lucky on this one. My main contract with <a href="https://www.mercy.net/">Mercy</a> got extended several times. <a href="https://twitter.com/adkron">Amos</a> and I must have been doing a good job of keeping the customer happy. We even made it through a couple rounds of layoffs. I&#8217;m wrapping up the gig at Mercy now. I&#8217;m working one day a week there, as the project winds down.</p>
<p>I also started a new gig this month at <a href="https://www.ctl.io/">CenturyLink</a>. I&#8217;m working on a cloud development team. Our current project involves selling <a href="https://www.ctl.io/wordpress/">WordPress as a service</a>. The manager had been courting me for most of the year. I&#8217;m excited about my new role; I&#8217;ll be writing about it in a blog post soon.</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p>I set a goal in 2014 to give my first conference talk. I accomplished that, giving <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2014-ruby-idioms-you-re-not-using-yet">an ambitious talk</a> at <a href="http://confreaks.tv/events/rubyconf2014">RubyConf</a>. I enjoyed having done that, and vowed to do more conference speaking.</p>
<p>I gave 3 conference talks in 2015. I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmfUfjpDpz0">workshop</a> on <a href="https://rawgit.com/booch/presentations/master/HTTP_Exploration/slides.html#1">HTTP</a> at RailsConf. I <a href="http://tinyurl.com/madruby-ii">talked</a> about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6MZi9OlW1Q">immutable infrastructure</a> at Madison+ Ruby. At RubyConf, I gave a talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZVSK4cjeF4">on a micro-ORM</a> <a href="https://github.com/boochtek/ruby_preserves">I wrote</a>. I also gave a <a href="https://rawgit.com/booch/presentations/master/No_Estimates/slides.html#1">lightning talk</a> about Agile estimation (#noestimates).</p>
<p>I was an alternate speaker at Windy City Rails, but did not give my talk on <a href="https://rawgit.com/booch/presentations/master/Alternatives_to_ActiveRecord/slides.html#1">Alternatives to ActiveRecord</a>. I also went to Strange Loop, mainly to see several friends and acquaintances speak.</p>
<h2>Blogging</h2>
<p>I wrote 24 blog articles this year. That&#8217;s about one every other week. What really kept me going was participating in a <a href="https://github.com/booch/pact#readme">writing pact</a>. When the pact was going, I had a 75% blogging rate. That&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure about the quality of my blog writing though. I know that practicing writing is supposed to make you better. I know I wrote some really good articles over the past year, but I think I also wrote some articles that weren&#8217;t very good. I think sometimes the deadline has caused more harm than good. I&#8217;m not really sure what to do about that; perhaps just pushing on is the right answer.</p>
<h2>Programming Language Design</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken a lot of notes on the design of my programming language. Any time I learn something interesting about another language, or come up with another idea, I write it down.</p>
<p>But I haven&#8217;t worked on the implementation. (I last worked on the implementation in 2014.) I should be experimenting with some ideas, implementing them to see how they work out. I&#8217;ve even kicked around the idea of starting with a Forth variant, just to get something working quickly.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t written any articles on my ideas this year either. My notes are pretty extensive, and it would be good to write some articles to help get my thoughts straight.</p>
<h2>Writing an Agile Book</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve got some things to say about Agile, and want to write a book to express those ideas. I&#8217;ve made a start — I&#8217;ve got the chapters outlines, and have started on a few chapters. But I haven&#8217;t made as much progress as I&#8217;d like to. I shared what I&#8217;ve got with Amos, and he showed some interest in pairing with me on the writing. Hopefully we&#8217;ll work on it together in 2016 and publish it.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>There were a few other accomplishments that weren&#8217;t explicitly on my list, but I&#8217;d like to call attention to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve continued participating on the <a href="http://www.thisagilelife.com/">This Agile Life</a> podcast. I was in 12 of the 33 episodes that were recorded in 2015. I hope to participate in more in 2016. We&#8217;re considering scheduling a standard recording night each week, which might help us record more regularly.</p>
<p>I recently took over as maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/solnic/virtus#readme">Virtus</a>, a library to declare attributes for Ruby model classes. I haven&#8217;t done a lot yet, since I&#8217;ve been busy with travel, vacation, and holidays. But I hope to catch up with all the pending pull requests and issues in the next month or so.</p>
<p>The accomplishment I&#8217;m most proud of is mentoring for the <a href="http://royclaysr.com/">Roy Clay Sr. Tech Impact</a> program. This is a program begun as a result of the Ferguson protest movement. We&#8217;re helping teach kids (from 14 to 25) web design and development. My personal goal was to give these kids an opportunity that they would not have otherwise had. But it turned out that some of them have actually started a business building web sites for small companies. I&#8217;m so proud of the progress they&#8217;ve made in such a short time; it&#8217;s a challenging program.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with my accomplishments this year. I made at least some progress on each of the goals I set. I&#8217;ve been thinking about my goals for next year; I&#8217;ll write that as a separate blog article next week.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve always been someone who faces my fears.</p>
<p>I have a moderate case of arachnophobia. I don&#8217;t run away when I see a spider, but it creeps my out when one is crawling on me. When I was in college, I decided to buy a tarantula to attempt to get over my irrational fear of spiders. I thought I&#8217;d be able to get more comfortable with the tarantula over time, eventually to the point of letting it crawl on my arm. It didn&#8217;t work. Although I did find that my fear of tarantulas is rational — I got a terrible case of hives just from touching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticating_hair">urticating hairs</a> that fell off into its water sponge.</p>
<p>Last week, I was on vacation in Mexico. One of the <a href="http://www.xenotes.com/">excursions</a> we took involved jumping in the water a lot. I&#8217;m not a strong swimmer — mostly because I have a hard time closing my nose; I hold my nose when I jump in. We zip-lined into the water a lot. At one point, there was a cliff to dive into the water from. It was about 15 feet above the water. It didn&#8217;t look so far down before jumping. But it felt like a really long way down the first time I jumped from it. It was pretty scary for me. So I did it a second time. There wasn&#8217;t any peer pressure to jump a second time. I literally jumped a second time specifically <strong>because</strong> I was scared.</p>
<p>Fear is a weird thing. Fear is there to protect us. But it&#8217;s there to protect us from the dangers of the African savannah. Most of the things our fears protect us from don&#8217;t exist in our everyday modern lives. So maybe we should work to gain a better understanding of how our fears work, to figure out when to pay attention to them and when to ignore them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our brain has a good mechanism to help us do this. Our brains basically have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">2 main processing systems</a>. The first one is for quick reactions. This one involves things that are nearly reflexes. Fear is in this system. The second system is our analytical reasoning system. This system takes longer to process, but is able to take on more information.</p>
<p>Whenever the situation allows us time for both systems to work, we need to listen to them both. We need to listen to our fears, because they&#8217;re there for a reason. But that reason might not pertain to our situation. So we need to realize that, and let the slow analytical system determine if we should ignore our fears.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t allow both systems to work, we&#8217;re not taking full advantage of our brains; we&#8217;re not taking full advantage of the situations that life is presenting to us.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been on vacation the past week, in Cozumel, Mexico. One day, we went on an excursion called Xenotes. A cenote (say-NO-tay) is a sinkhole filled with fresh water. (The &#8220;X&#8221; is to give it a more Mayan-sounding trademarkable name.) We had a lot of fun swimming, kayaking, and zip-lining. A bilingual tour guide led our group, which consisted of people from across the US and South America, of various ages and physical abilities.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was a lot of fun. He made jokes, told us about the cenotes, and led us in the activities. But he also encouraged us. When someone was scared to do something, he was supportive. He told us that it was okay, and we could do it. But we also felt like it was OK to fail, if we really couldn&#8217;t. It really felt like his encouragement was literally creating courage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">What was really neat was that despite the language barrier, everyone else was also supportive and encouraging. Everyone cheered with encouragement before someone would attempt something difficult. And we&#8217;d cheer especially loud once someone accomplished something that was difficult for their abilities.</span></p>
<p>It was an awesome feeling to feel so supported. It made me feel like I was in a safe place, where I could try new things that were a little past my comfort zone. I was able to do the zip-line upside-down. I jumped off a 15-foot cliff into the water. I even jumped off the cliff a second time, even though I was a little scared.</p>
<p>Back at the resort, we played some volleyball in the pool. It was a similar situation, with players of varying ages and abilities. Again, we tried to help the weaker players feel comfortable so they could improve without feeling judged or self-conscious. It helped everyone have a good time. It made everything more fun to be in such a supportive environment, whether I was in a position as one of the more skilled (volleyball), or one of the less skilled (jumping or zip-lining into the water). We were all able to accomplish more, with less effort.</p>
<p>These experiences provide a good lesson that can be applied in a lot of places. Such a supportive environment would help any relationship, and any team. I&#8217;ve been on a couple really good software development teams, but I don&#8217;t think any of them have been as supportive as these two groups of strangers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided that this should be one of my goals as a team leader. I want to create an encouraging environment for the whole team. I want to make sure that everyone is comfortable enough that they feel like they can try things that are difficult, even if they might fail (as long as nobody gets hurt).</p>
<p>If a group of strangers can do this, so can your team. So can you and your significant others. We need to work every day to make sure that we&#8217;re supporting each other. It&#8217;s the best way to get everyone to achieve more.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I got my first computer in 1984. It was a Commodore 64. I had to do extra chores and save up my allowance to buy it. I was 13.</p>
<p>Back then, Sears and other retail stores had Commodore 64 computers out on display. Whenever I went to the store, I&#8217;d write a short BASIC program and leave it running on the display computers:</p>
<pre>10 PRINT "CRAIG IS GREAT!"
20 GOTO 10</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Hey, I was a 13-year-old kid. Later, I got a little more sophisticated. </span>I&#8217;d change the background color instead. I still remember the POKE address:</p>
<pre>10 FOR I=0 TO 255
20 POKE 53281, I
30 NEXT I
40 GOTO 10
RUN</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">This was fast enough to change the background color every few scan lines, </span>creating a flashing scrolling effect.</p>
<p>Later, I learned 6502 assembly language. I translated the BASIC program into assembler, and memorized the bytes to type in at the store. In assembly language, the background color would change several times per scan line. The effect was kind of psychedelic.</p>
<p>All that happened in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to about 2000 or so. I was telling the above story after a St. Louis LUG meeting. I explained how I had memorized the 10 or 12 bytes of machine code, and would leave the program running with its psychedelic effect.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a bit, I thought that 10 or 12 bytes seemed too much. It actually bothered me — I couldn&#8217;t fall asleep when I got home. I got up and found my old 6502 manuals. I figured out how to write the code in 7 bytes. I installed the Vice C64 emulator on my Linux desktop, and tested my code. It worked as expected. (The emulator was already clock-cycle perfect by then.) Here&#8217;s the assembly code:</p>
<pre>INX         ; $E8           ; 232
STX $D021   ; $8E $21 $D0   ; 142 33 208   ; $D021 = 53281
JMP $C000   ; $4C $00 $C0   ; 76 0 192     ; $C000 = 49152</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s the BASIC program to store that program in memory and run it:</p>
<pre>10 FOR N=49152 TO 49152+6: READ Q : POKE N, Q : NEXT
20 DATA 232, 142, 33, 208, 76, 0, 192

<p><span style="font-weight: 300; background-color: #ffffff;">The moral of the story is that you can optimize even a 10-byte program, 15 years after the last time it was used. So don&#8217;t tell me that your program can&#8217;t be improved, no matter how small it is.</span></p>
<p>PS. I rewrote the code above while writing this article in 2015, about 15 years after the last time I rewrote it. And I again downloaded Vice to test it, this time on Mac OS X.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m wrapping up my current consulting gig at Mercy in December, and starting a new gig at CenturyLink. I&#8217;m a software developer, but that&#8217;s only a part of what I do. What I really do is join a team and help them improve the way they work — both their processes and their technical skills.</p>
<p>I think this is a key differentiator for me as a consultant. Most consultants (and Agile coaches) come in and tell people what to do. I don&#8217;t like to just tell people what to do. I&#8217;d much prefer to work side-by-side with them, getting a better understanding of what their challenges are. Once I have a better understanding of the challenges, I&#8217;m able to better brainstorm some ideas to try. Then we can experiment to see what will work and what won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Instead of telling people what to do, I show them how. Most people learn better from seeing than from hearing. They also learn better if you explain how and why, not just what. So showing them how to do something is more effective than telling them. By showing and doing, you can also set<span style="font-weight: 300;"> a good example. This is especially important when collaboration is a large part of what needs to be improved.</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that this style of consulting is more highly respected by everyone. I build trust with developers by working closely with them. Managers<span style="font-weight: 300;"> like to keep me around once they see how effective these methods can be, so the gigs I take on tend to last relatively long.</span></p>
<p>The biggest problem I have is explaining how this works. I don&#8217;t really know what to put on my résumé. Sometimes I call myself an Agile practitioner, and sometimes an Agile player/coach. But those aren&#8217;t terribly satisfying descriptions. I&#8217;m considering actually putting &#8220;I help teams improve the way they work — both their processes and their technical skills&#8221; on the résumé. But that seems awkward, and misses the show versus tell part. I&#8217;d be open to any suggestions.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I facilitated a retrospective today; it was one of the best retros I&#8217;ve ever been involved with. I figured out what activities I wanted to do earlier in the morning. They were really quite simple. I wanted to focus on happiness.</p>
<h2>How happy are you at work?</h2>
<p>I started with two questions that I&#8217;ve used with teams before, to some success (although not so successful for one particular team). The first question I asked was &#8220;How happy are you at work?&#8221; I had them put a rating from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning they should have quit last week, and 10 meaning they couldn&#8217;t imaging being happier at work.</p>
<p>The answers were mostly 7s and 8s, with a 5 and a 9. The average came to 7.5, which is pretty good. The 5 concerns me a bit, especially that it&#8217;s 2 points lower than anyone else&#8217;s answer.</p>
<h2>How effective do you think the teams is?</h2>
<p>The next question I asked was &#8220;How effective do you think the teams is?&#8221;. Again, from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning they can&#8217;t accomplish anything, and 10 meaning you couldn&#8217;t imagine a more effective team.</p>
<p>When I ask both of these questions, the scores are always highly correlated. If your team isn&#8217;t doing good work, it&#8217;ll make you unhappy. And if you are unhappy, you&#8217;re less likely to do your best work. This team was no different; the 5 and 9 became a 6 and a 10, and most of the 7s became 8s, for an average of just under 8.</p>
<h2>What makes you happy at work?</h2>
<p>The next question I asked was &#8220;What makes you happy at work?&#8221;. The answers were mostly about the teamwork and teammates. This went quicker than I expected. At this point, I was worried the retro would only last a little more than 30 minutes.</p>
<h2>What would make you happier at work?</h2>
<p>The final question I asked was &#8220;What would make you happier at work?&#8221;. This was the real pay-off. We spent about half an hour just talking about the things that would make us happier, and what we could do to improve our happiness. We came up with 10 potential action items. I usually limit teams to trying 3 or 4 action items, but most of the items are quite small, so we&#8217;re going to try 6 of them. One is just observing another team&#8217;s standup meetings, to see how they&#8217;re using their time effectively.</p>
<p>Everyone went away feeling that this was a really good retro. It felt good to focus on happiness. Happiness is something I&#8217;ve been talking a lot about on the This Agile Life podcast, and it felt good to take some action on it. I&#8217;ve done &#8220;positive-only&#8221; retros before, but this one felt even better than that, by specifically targeting happiness and how we can achieve it.</p>
