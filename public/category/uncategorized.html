	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently attended an Open Space hosted at work. I&#8217;d never been to an Open Space, and didn&#8217;t know what to expect. We&#8217;d been told that this was a workshop to help Engineering Managers (my role), Product Owners, and Product Analysts find better ways of working together. But due to the way an Open Space works, it evolved into something completely different — and better.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d brought in Diana Larsen to facilitate the Open Space. Diana is a stalwart of the Agile community, focusing on how people and teams interact. She literally (co-)wrote the book on Agile retrospectives. Diana was also kind enough to be our guest at an Agile LINC meetup later in the evening.</p>
<p>The morning started off with all the participants sitting in chairs arranged in a circle. Diana rang a chime, a nice soothing tone that literally set the tone for the day. (Most people didn&#8217;t seem to like it, but I thought it had its purpose.) It also acted as a call to gather in the meeting space. She then walked around the inside of the circle as she explained what was going to happen.</p>
<p>The idea behind Open Spaces came with the realization that at a conference, the &#8220;hallway track&#8221; (ad hoc discussions in the hallways) was often more valuable than the scheduled talks. So they figured out a way to capture that experience. There are only a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoever shows up is the right group</li>
<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>
<li>Be prepared to be surprised</li>
<li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s over</li>
<li>The Law of 2 Feet: If you&#8217;re not learning or contributing, go somewhere else</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Diana set the scene and explained the rules, people came up and presented ideas for topics. If you proposed a topic, you chose a time and location on the topic board. At that time, you&#8217;d facilitate a discussion on that topic. The format was really conducive to discussions. There was no preparation, so discussions were from the heart — lots of people felt that they could contribute.</p>
<p>Being new to the company (only 2 months), I got a lot out of the workshop, beyond the content itself. I got to get to know several more people. I&#8217;d even say I made a few friends. Having open discussions, we found that many of the teams were having the same issues. This made it easy for me to talk to other people.</p>
<p>All-in-all, I found the Open Space to be extremely conducive to discussions aimed at identifying issues, brainstorming solutions, and planning action items. I felt like we made great strides in addressing some of the biggest problems our organization is currently facing.</p>

	<header class="entry-header">
		
		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/http://blog.boochtek.com/2016/01/19/resolutions-2016" rel="bookmark">Resolutions for 2016</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve written up a list of career-related resolutions the past few years. I&#8217;ve been pretty successful meeting those goals, so I&#8217;m going to continue the tradition.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I want to increase the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/https://github.com/boochtek">Open Source code I write</a> this year. That&#8217;s basically everything I write that&#8217;s not directly related to work.</p>
<p>I took over maintenance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/https://github.com/solnic/virtus#readme">Virtus</a> late last year, but haven&#8217;t done a good job at finding the time for that. That&#8217;s probably more responding to issues on GitHub and merging pull requests. But eventually, I&#8217;ll likely add some features and do some refactoring.</p>
<p>My goal is to work on 6 apps and libraries this year. That&#8217;s a pretty aggressive goal, but I want to focus on both learning new things and building some simple but useful things. Think MVP — focus on getting a lot of bang for not too much effort.</p>
<p>I want to work on a new Rails app, to familiarize myself with Rails 5. I want to get some experience with some more modern gems. I also want to see if I can use some new techniques with a Rails app, especially things that might help us get closer to a hexagonal architecture. I&#8217;m also hoping to work with some different web frameworks — maybe Lotus, Rodakase, Trailblazer, or Phoenix. Or maybe one of the Crystal web frameworks.</p>
<p>I also want to work on a couple Elm apps. I started the STL Elm group as an excuse to learn the language. I&#8217;d like to work on a Twitter client, that might eventually turn into a more general reading app. Beyond Twitter, it would keep track of things I want to read. The other Elm app I&#8217;d like to write is a game, based on the old Space Taxi game I loved to play on the Commodore 64.</p>
<p>I wrote a micro-ORM last year called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/https://github.com/boochtek/ruby_preserves">Ruby Preserves</a>. I&#8217;ve started converting that from working with raw SQL to sitting atop the awesome <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/index.html">Sequel</a> gem. The simplicity is still there so far, and basing it on Sequel has so far gone easier than I expected. But I haven&#8217;t figured out how to do relationships (JOINs) yet; that will be the real test.</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with my 2015 conference experience. I want to keep my conference level about the same. I don&#8217;t really want to commit to more talks than I gave last year. Conference presentations take a lot of time and energy to write and practice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to go to RailsConf, RubyConf, and Strange Loop. I&#8217;m hoping to give a talk at each of those, if I can. But I&#8217;ll probably attend all of them even if I&#8217;m not speaking. I&#8217;m also submitting a talk to Agile 2016. I&#8217;m unlikely to go to any other conferences, and even more unlikely to give more than 4 conference talks.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I really want to finish my Effective Agile book this year. I&#8217;m going to try to pull Amos in to pair with me on it occasionally, to move it forward. If I&#8217;m able to get it done, I&#8217;d also like to maybe write a book on Elm.</p>
<p>I actually want to do <strong>less</strong> blogging this year. Well, sort of. I want to put coding and book writing ahead of blogging. If that means less blogging, I&#8217;m okay with that. So my goal for blogging is more like every other week. And when I do write a blog article, I&#8217;d rather it be related to some code I&#8217;m working on, something that I could use in my book, or some more in-depth thoughts about programming language design.</p>
<h2>Job Hunting</h2>
<p>The contract I recently started at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/https://www.ctl.io/">CenturyLink Cloud</a> is open-ended, so I&#8217;ll likely be there for the entire year. I&#8217;m enjoying it so far; it&#8217;s a challenge, but I think I can make a significant impact. However, I&#8217;m really interested in moving to San Francisco in 2017. So I&#8217;m going to work on preparing for that in several ways.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to resurrect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigbuchek">my LinkedIn account</a>. I&#8217;ve neglected it for a few years now. I&#8217;ll make sure everything is up to date, and make some connections I&#8217;ve been putting off. I also want to reclaim my Stack Exchange and Hacker News accounts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to pay a an expert to help me revamp <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200924/https://github.com/booch/resume">my résumé</a>. I think it&#8217;s pretty decent, but it could use some freshening up. I want it to stand out. I want to do a better job of explaining what I really do — which is to join a team to help them improve their processes and their technical skills.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also need to clean up all my web sites, so they look nice when people come to take a look at them. This includes my personal site, consulting business site, wiki, and blogs. I should also upgrade my server to the latest version of Debian, and use Ansible and some other tools to provision it using the principles of Infrastructure as Code.</p>
